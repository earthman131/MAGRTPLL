# MAGRTPLL

Two methods for magnetic reduction to the pole at low latitudes.

Developed by Lianghui Guo.

# Principles

MAGRTPLL is a MatLab code of the two methods for magnetic reduction to the pole (rtp) at low latitudes.One is the antisymmetric factor method for magnetic reduction to the pole (rtp) at low latitudes，which is a new wavenumber-domain method for RTP at low latitudes, herein calledthe antisymmetric factor method, based on modification of the RIP factor. The method applies the antisymmetricfactor in a given scope of directions centered along the magnetic declination to suppress amplification of the RTPfactor, stabilizing the RTP. Meanwhile it utilizes the routine RTP factor in other directions to preserve the effectiveRTP features. The other is the pseudo inclination method for magnetic reduction to the pole at low latitudes

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script main_rtp_af.m and on MATLAB.
